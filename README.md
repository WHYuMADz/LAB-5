# LAB-5

#Terminal Log Files

#For Task 1, what i did at the beginning is to decide which CSV file to use and then searching the terminal commands for it. First, what I did during the project is to download the zip.file using curl and download it into a zip archive containing the CSV file to a Lab5 directory that I created already.Then, in order to unzip the CSV file, #I use the command "unzip" to zip the file. Then I used the head command to read the first 10 lines of a CSV file that I selected. Then I read the total number of lines in the #CSV. Then I selected the 3rd column in the CSV which contained movie ratings. I used cat to select the column and output it to a text file. Then I use the sort command to reverse #sort the text file numerically line-by-line. Finally, I used head again to show what the selected and sorted column looks like in the text file.
